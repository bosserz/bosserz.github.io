      <p>In rapidly growing urban areas, the availability and equitable distribution of parking spaces are essential for 
        sustaining urban mobility and ensuring the efficient functionality of cities. An imbalance between parking demand 
        and supply has significant implications, contributing to issues such as traffic congestion, inefficient land use, 
        and environmental challenges. Moreover, the increasing pace of urbanization, coupled with fluctuating vehicle usage 
        patterns throughout the day, poses additional challenges for cities attempting to address this imbalance effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The imbalance between parking demand and supply in urban areas has been extensively studied, revealing significant 
            impacts on traffic congestion, land use efficiency, and environmental quality. Ibrahim (2017) identifies the rapid 
            increase in car ownership and ineffective land use planning as primary contributors to parking shortages, leading to 
            traffic congestion and inefficient land utilization.
            Shoup (2005) discusses how underpriced or free parking exacerbates urban congestion, as drivers spend additional time 
            searching for available spaces, thereby increasing traffic volumes and associated emissions. Furthermore, the proliferation 
            of parking infrastructure consumes substantial urban land, which could otherwise support housing or green spaces, thus 
            affecting urban density and environmental quality. The environmental consequences of excessive parking infrastructure 
            are also notable. The abundance of parking spaces encourages car use, leading to increased emissions of pollutants such 
            as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, which degrade air quality and contribute to environmental degradation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Addressing the imbalance between parking demand and supply is crucial for enhancing urban mobility, 
            optimizing land use, and mitigating environmental impacts. Strategies such as dynamic performance-based pricing for parking 
            spaces have been proposed to reduce vehicle circling and improve space utilization, thereby decreasing traffic congestion and emissions.
            Moreover, the adoption of smart parking systems can lead to more efficient use of existing parking structures and land, 
            as well as reductions in congestion caused by drivers searching for parking.

        <h4>Demand / Visitor Counts</h4>

        <p>We used Monthly Pattern - Foot Traffic data from Advan Research to calculate the demand of parking lots. The data contain contains 
            aggregated and anonymized insights into the number of visits to specific points of interest (e.g., businesses, retail locations, parks, schools) 
            based on mobile device location data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following information of the dataset were used in this analysis.

        <h4>Parking Spaces Regression</h4>
        
        <p>The parking lot data from SafeGraph offers a greater number of data points but lacks information on the number 
            of parking spaces. In contrast, the data from OSM includes parking space details. To leverage the strengths of 
            both datasets, we combine them and apply linear regression to estimate the number of parking spaces based on 
            the geometric area of the parking lots.

        <h4>Parking Demand Estimation</h4>
        
        <p>
            From the visitor data for POIs, we excluded the number of visitors traveling from nearby census block groups (within a 0.5-mile buffer) 
            under the assumption that these visitors likely walked to the POIs and did not require parking. Additionally, we excluded visitors who 
            potentially used public transit to reach the POIs. This adjustment was made by estimating transit accessibility for each POI using a 
            gravity-based model and reducing the number of visitors presumed to have driven. The figures below illustrate the logic behind our 
            calculation of visits to POIs.

        <p>We then used the Two-step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method to estimate the parking demands loaded to each parking lot. 
            2SFCA is a widely used accessibility measure to see how many resources (i.e., facilities) an individual can access to within 
            certain geographical distributions of resources supplied and individuals in demand (Luo and Wang, 2003). In detail, the 2SFCA 
            method consists of the following two steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Measure how much resources, provided by each supplying facility, are available with respect to an individual in demand, 
                considering the competition she or he (they) face with others for the resources at that facility.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sum up the available resources from multiple supply facilities within a certain boundary of each individual.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Since our study focuses on the degree of scarcity or over-supply of parking lots in Atlanta, we decided to use the inverted 
            version of 2SFCA, which was suggested and theoretically verified by Wang (2018). In the inverted version of 2SFCA, the unit 
            of analysis changes from individuals to facilities, parking lots in our study. Along with illustrations, our method of estimating 
            parking demands consists of two steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Distribute parking demand of each POI to nearby parking lots: Presume that there are 20 visitors to POI C. The parking 
                demands of these 20 visitors are split into the two nearby parking lots. Here, we consider the distance decay effect where 
                the possibility of an individual visitor choosing a certain parking lot is inverse to the distance between the POI she or he 
                intends to visit and the parking lot (please refer to the equation below). Walking distances between POIs and parking lots were 
                calculated using the Open Street Routing Machine (OSRM), and the decay effect has been considered for only the parking lots within 
                the 10-minute walking distance from each POI. Three distance decay parameters (k=1, 2, 3) were used, according to the literature 
                (Luo and Wang, 2003), but we mainly discuss the outputs based on the parameter k=2 in our Result section.

            <div class="text-center">
                \[
                \text{Prob}_{ij} = \frac{D_j d_{ij}^{-k}}{\sum_{l=1}^{n} \left( D_l d_{il}^{-k} \right)}

            demand over time on weekdays, while the right shows the average demand over time on weekends.
        </p>
        <p>
            The choropleth map highlights areas with high parking demand. From the two charts, we observe that Midtown and Downtown 
            consistently experience high demand, while certain areas show elevated demand only during specific times of the day.

        <h5>Demand By Location</h5>
        <p>
            Using the estimated parking demand by time of day, we can identify periods with high demand issues in specific areas. Three locations were selected for analysis: Downtown, Glenwood Park, and Beltline & Ponce City Market.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <div>

            </div>
            <caption>Demand Over Time of Selected Locations</caption>
        </div>
        <p>
            The results show that Downtown consistently faces over-demand issues throughout the day, whereas Glenwood Park and BeltLine & Ponce City Market experiences over-demand in specific periods of time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Imbalanced Parking Demand and Supply</h4>
        <p>
            We developed an interactive dashboard to visualize the imbalance in the parking demand-to-supply ratio using a choropleth map. 
            The dashboard includes filters for parameters such as the exponential decay parameter (k), day type (weekday or weekend), demand estimation mode, and time of day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The map displays the locations and spatial geometries of parking lots in the City of Atlanta. Polygons are color-coded to 
            represent the degree of imbalance between parking demand and supply: darker reds indicate areas with high over-demand, while 
            darker greens highlight areas of oversupply. On the right-hand side, the top bar chart shows the distribution of parking imbalance 
            in the area, and the bottom bar chart illustrates the demand versus referenced supply of the parking lots over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can select specific polygons on the map using Tableau's selection tools to filter parking lots within their areas of interest. 
            The bar charts dynamically update to reflect data corresponding to the selected polygons, offering a focused view of the parking dynamics in the chosen regions.
        </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Based on our analysis, we would like to discuss the following three points particularly regarding parking management policies in cities.</p>

        <div class=>
            <p>
                First, we notice that even places with fairly high transit access face parking overdemand issues. Two metro lines, line Red 
                and Gold, go through the Midtown Atlanta area, placing the area as one of the places with higher levels of transit accessibility 
                in the city. However, as we can see from the figure below, the Midtown also suffers from parking over-demand issues. This might 
                be because the transit accessibility here is not high enough to promote people to opt for public transit over personal vehicles 
                or there are other problems besides accessibility to stations in the public transit system (e.g., long headways and dispatch intervals).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center">
            <div>
                <img src="assets/img/conclusion/conclusion_1.png" alt="" class="w-100">
            </div>
            <caption>Imbalance between Parking Demand and Supply in Atlanta</caption>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p>
                Second, focusing on local scales, parking demands do not often spread across nearby parking lots. The figure below shows a zoomed-in 
                distribution of estimated parking demands near the Ponce City Market area, a famous attraction in Atlanta. While there are spaces available 
                across the Ponce de Leon Avenue, those spaces are estimated to be not fully used by the visitors of the Ponce City Market. While further 
                investigations on the actual parking usages are needed, we would like to note that chances that people are reluctant to cross roads after 
                parking can exist. What if the roads that visitors need to cross after parking to get to their final destinations (i.e., POIs) have crosswalks 
                without traffic lights? What if the average speed of vehicles on roads is so high that people feel unsafe to cross the road. These 
                hazards may affect visitors' parking behaviors and as a result lead to inefficient uses of parking spaces across urban areas. For planning 
                practices, we suggest that walkability between parking lots and POIs should be improved to enhance parking imbalance problems and eventually 
                downsize parking lots or at least avoid from enlarging them based on inefficient uses.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                Third, we created an interactive map dashboard, which can be used for parking management policies. There is much debate going on 
                regarding the reform of parking requirement policies in cities across the US (Marsden, 2006; Willson, 2018). Such policies 
                require both assessments on status quo and simulations based on projections of future parking demands. Additionally, the supply 
                and demand dynamics of parking varies across contexts, specifically the density of development, the overall transportation 
                infrastructure in the city, and the categories of POIs, etc. This implies that the assessment of parking imbalance should be 
                monitored and estimated for each case and from the perspective of diverse stakeholders. We suggest that our interactive map, 
                which allows users to adjust different time periods and parameters, can be instrumental to facilitating the debate on the parking 
                management policies and to assisting local businesses and building facility operators.

      <h3>Limitations & Improvements</h3>
      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
            The regression model used to estimate parking capacities achieved an R-squared value of 0.69, indicating a moderate fit and leaving room for improvement in prediction accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
            The study relies on assumptions about walking or public transit usage to estimate the proportion of visitors requiring parking, which may not reflect actual behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
            A simplified assumption of one visitor per vehicle was made, potentially oversimplifying the complexity of visitor behavior and vehicle occupancy patterns.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <h4>Improvements</h4>
      
      <p>To address the above limitations, we propose the following improvements for future studies:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Incorporating additional features, such as the number of nearby points of interest (POIs) and the built environment characteristics of the area, and applying advanced machine learning models, could enhance the predictive accuracy of parking capacity estimates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Validating the proportion of visitors who travel by car would improve the reliability of the demand estimates. This can be achieved by collecting data on car-traveling visitors from a representative sample of locations and fine-tuning the model based on the collected data.
        </li>
